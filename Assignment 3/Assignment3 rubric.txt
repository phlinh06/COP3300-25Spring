Detailed Rubric:

1. Implementation Using LinkedList (+20)
   - Full points if implemented with `LinkedList`. 
   - 20 points will be reduced if using `ArrayList`, `Array`, or other non-permitted structures.

2. Submission Rules and Compilation(+25)
   - Full points if submission follows all rules (no class files, proper file names, etc.) and compiles
   - 10 points will be reduced if the package name or class file names are incorrect
   - 25 points will be reduced if the code does not get compiled. Also you won't get any grade from output.

  
3. Private Instance Variables (+10)
   - Full points if all instance variables are private.
   - (-5) points if any instance variable is not private.

4. Public Methods (+10)
   - Full points if all methods are public, and no `setItem` method is present.
   - (-10) points if there is any `setItem` method or methods are not public.

5. Output Correctness (+15)
   - +15 points if all output entries are correct.
   - +10 points if only one output entry is missing.
   - **+5 points** if fewer than 10 output entries are missing.
   - **0 points** if no output or more than 10 entries are missing.

6. Code Comments (+10)
   - **+10 points** if each file contains comments explaining the code. If no header comments 10 pts will be reduced.

7. Code Efficiency and Structure (+10)
   - **+5 points** if there is a method to read the file to LinkedList( construct() )
   - **+5 points** if there is a method to process the LinkedList ( process() )
