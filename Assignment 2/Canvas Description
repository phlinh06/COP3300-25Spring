The late submission window will close in 24 hours. If you submit late, you will lose 15% of your grade. Under no circumstances, late submissions will be accepted after the late window. Emails containing submissions to TAs or to the instructor will be ignored.

 

Do NOT forget to add comments as much as possible. Include a header comment for your file and for your additional methods if you have written.

Header comment includes your name and lastname. PID/NID. Assignment number and what does your program do in a few sentences.

Proper indentation is also important. Please see the course slides to see appropriate indentation styles.

 

Upload rules:

Zip three files and upload the zip file. Do not put the java files in a folder and zip the folder. When we open the zip file, we should be able to see 3 files inside without a seeing a folder first. Do not RAR the file. Just use zip. You will lose 10 pts if your submission does not follow this rule.

Name your zip file as Lastname_Firstname.zip

You need to upload 3 java files. Die.java, Dice.java and Lastname_Firstname.java. Your last submission will be taken into account. You can upload as often as you like.

The histogram graph generating code will be inside Lastname_Firstname.java. The other classes (dice and die) should NOT have a main method inside. All your java files will be inside package assignment2. In other words, all your java files should have package assignment2; in the first line.
