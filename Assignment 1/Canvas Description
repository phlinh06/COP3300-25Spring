The late submission window will close in 24 hours. If you submit late, you will lose 15% of your grade. Under no circumstances, late submissions will be accepted after the late window. Emails containing submissions to TAs or to the instructor will be ignored.

 

Do NOT forget to add comments as much as possible. Include a header comment for your file and for your additional methods if you have written.

Proper indentation is also important. Please see the course slides to see appropriate indentation styles.

 

You need to upload one java file. Your last submission will be taken into account. You can upload as often as you like.

You will need to name your java file as "Lastname_Firstname.java". Therefore the class name will need to be "Lastname_Firstname"

 

example file content whose name is Doe_John.java

package assignment1;

//imports...

public class Doe_John{

...

}

 

DO NOT upload class file. If your file is not readable, you will get zero.

DO NOT wait until the last minute.  There will be no exception for assignments couldn't be submitted one minute before the due date/time. Submit EARLY.
